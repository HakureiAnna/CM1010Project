Follow the following instructions to run the project.

1. Change to the project directory.
2. Run npm install, to install the modules required by the project.
3. Run node index.js to start the express server.

Note: 
- Given the word limit, a lot of details of the design cannot be discussed here, please refer to the comments within the code base for further information.

- For references 1-3, since a great number of documentation pages are consulted from these two sources during the development, only an entry point to the documentation is provided, but no. 4 is the actual URI for a particular question and answer on the stackoverflow website that helped greatly for implementing the external data sources.

- The original git support files are removed, the git files currently present are those for a new repository, it is hosted on a private repository on my personal GitHub account (hakurei.anna@gmail.com), I am using the issues system to keep track of progress and functionalities I intend to implement later during the project.
